# AI-Final-Project
Final project for CS 402 Artificial Intelligence at Whitman College.

Preprocessing: KDD Cup 2010 is an educational data mining competition. The data comes from Carnegie Learning and DataShop. This is the training set of the first problem: algebra_2008_2009. We have provide a transformed version used by the winner (National Taiwan Univ). Because labels of the competition's testing set are not available, the training data is split into two sets for training and validation. The validation set is called the testing set here. To access the raw data set, please check the above "KDD CUP 2010" link. This data set is only to be used for research purposes. Users please acknowledge the data is from Carnegie Learning and DataShop. [HFY10c]
